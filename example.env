# For information on installation and configuration, see http://sfm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html.

# Note that changes made to this file AFTER SFM is brought up will require one or

# COMMON CONFIGURATION
TZ=America/New_York
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=sfm

# VOLUME CONFIGURATION
# Volumes come in 2 types: normal Docker volumes (e.g., /sfm-data)
# or host volumes (which link to an external location; e.g., /src/sfm-data:/sfm-data).
# An internal volume should be adequate for development; for production,
# you probably want to use a link to an external location.
# Note that the external location should be created before SFM is brought up.
# The data volume is where:
# * all of harvested social media content is stored.
# * the db files are located.
# * web harvests are stored.
DATA_VOLUME=/sfm-data
#DATA_VOLUME=/src/sfm-data:/sfm-data
# The processing volume is where processed data is stored when using a processing
# container. Use porcessing.docker-compose.yml to start a processing container.
PROCESSING_VOLUME=/sfm-processing
#PROCESSING_VOLUME=/src/sfm-processing:/sfm-processing

# DOCKER LOG CONFIGURATION
# This limits the size of the logs kept by Docker for each container.
# For more information, see https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/#json-file-options
